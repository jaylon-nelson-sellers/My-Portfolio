Here is the CompTIA Skill Tree, organized by difficulty and logical progression.

### **Optimal Study Strategy**

  * **Batch Size:** 1-2 exams at a time. (e.g., A+ Core 1 & Core 2, or Network+ & Server+).
  * **General Order:** Start at the "Roots" (Fundamentals), move up the "Trunk" (Core Skills), then choose a "Branch" (Specialization) to climb to the "Canopy" (Expert).
  * **Prerequisites:** Most upper-tier exams strongly rely on knowledge from the tiers below them.

-----

### **Tier 1: The Roots (Fundamentals)**

*Best for absolute beginners or students with 0 years of experience.*

  * **Microsoft Excel Pro**

      * **Focus:** Advanced Excel skills, data visualization, and productivity.
      * **Difficulty:** Very Easy (Skill Credential).
      * **Study Time:** 2–4 weeks (20–40 hours).
      * **Order:** First step for the Data path; useful for any office role.

  * **Tech+** (Replaces ITF+)

      * **Focus:** Pre-career survey of IT, coding, cyber, and data concepts.
      * **Difficulty:** Very Easy (1/10).
      * **Study Time:** 2–4 weeks (20–40 hours).
      * **Order:** Take *only* if you have zero computer knowledge. Otherwise, skip to A+.

  * **Project+**

      * **Focus:** IT Project management (Agile, Waterfall, documentation).
      * **Difficulty:** Easy (3/10).
      * **Study Time:** 3–6 weeks (30–60 hours).
      * **Order:** Flexible. Good to pair with Network+ or Security+ to break up technical fatigue.

-----

### **Tier 2: The Trunk (Core Professional)**

*The "Trifecta" (A+, Net+, Sec+) lives here. Essential for getting hired.*

  * **A+** (Core 1 & Core 2)

      * **Focus:** Device hardware, troubleshooting, Windows/Linux OS, basic security.
      * **Difficulty:** Moderate (Volume is high) (4/10).
      * **Study Time:** 2–4 months total (120–180 hours).
      * **Order:** The industry standard entry point. Do this first.

  * **Network+**

      * **Focus:** TCP/IP, subnets, routing, switching, and physical cabling.
      * **Difficulty:** Moderate/Hard (Conceptually dense) (5/10).
      * **Study Time:** 1.5–3 months (60–100 hours).
      * **Order:** Do this after A+. It is the foundation for *everything* above it.

  * **Security+**

      * **Focus:** Core cybersecurity principles, risk management, encryption, and enterprise safety.
      * **Difficulty:** Moderate (5.5/10).
      * **Study Time:** 1–2 months (60–80 hours).
      * **Order:** Do this after Network+. It completes the "Core" stack.

  * **Data+**

      * **Focus:** Data mining, analysis, visualization, and governance.
      * **Difficulty:** Moderate (4.5/10).
      * **Study Time:** 6–10 weeks (50–80 hours).
      * **Order:** Take after A+ or Excel Pro if pursuing the Data Branch.
